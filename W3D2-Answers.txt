//: # W3D2 - Optionals
//: 
//: ## Challenge 1

var inputString = "hello"
var converted = Int(inputString) // this is an "Int?" because itâ€™s an optional

//: ## Challenge 2

var number = Int("ðŸ”¥")
number! + 1 // this crashes the playground because number is nil and weâ€™re force-unwrapping it.

//: ## Challenge 3

// no answer, just explore conditional unwraps by changing the value of number to nil or some number.

//: ## Challenge 4

var greeting: String? = "Aloha!" // should try changing this to nil to make sure both the if and the else part work.

if let greeting = greeting {
    print(greeting)
} else {
    print("no greeting")
}
